 Convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds analogous to a set of
certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number
leaving no remainder.
Rules:
1. If a given number has “3” as a factor, add “Pling” to the result.
2. If a given number has “5” as a factor, add “Plang” to the result.
3. If a given number has “7” as a factor, add “Plong” to the result.
4. If a given number does not have any of the “3”, “5”, “7” as a factor, the result
should be the digits of the number.
Examples:
1. 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be “Plong”.
2. 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be “PlingPlang”
3. 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be ”34”.
